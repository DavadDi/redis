Subject: Collected Debian patches for Anchor-specific redis
Author: Matt Palmer <mpalmer@hezmatt.org>
    
The Anchor Redis package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining
patches as separate files, and separating the patches doesn't seem to be
worth the effort.  They are therefore all included in this single Debian
patch.
